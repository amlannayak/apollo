## Apollo

Apollo is a simple voice-enabled Spotify controller. It can be invoked with the command "Hey, Apollo!" followed 
by audio player control commands such as the following:

- "Play 'Your Hand in Mine' by Explosions in the Sky"
- "Pause"
- "Skip this one"
- "Previous song"
- "Add this one to playlist /<playlist_name/>"

This project it in its infancy and will be improved with time.
